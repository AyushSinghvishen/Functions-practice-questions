# Python Functions Practice

This repository contains a collection of Python programs focused on practicing **functions, control flow, and problem-solving**, with an emphasis on clean and reusable code. Each program is designed as a small, self-contained module, making it easy to understand and extend.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

1. **Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter** (`celsius_to_fahrenheit.py`)  
   Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using a simple function.

2. **Area of Rectangle** (`area_of_rectangle.py`)  
   Calculates the area of a rectangle with input validation and a reusable function.

3. **Distance Covered by Vehicle** (`distance_covered.py`)  
   Computes distance based on speed and time, demonstrating clear function-based logic.

4. **Number of Lift Rounds** (`lift_rounds.py`)  
   Determines how many trips a lift needs to transport a group of people. Highlights the use of control flow inside functions.

5. **Line Equation Calculator** (`line_equation.py`)  
   Calculates the value of `y` using the slope-intercept form of a line (`y = mx + b`). Focuses on modular code and reusability.

## Key Highlights

- Each program is written using **functions** for modularity and readability.  
- **Input validation** is included for safe execution.  
- The code is structured in a way that mirrors real-world programming practices, making it useful for learners and professionals alike.  
- Easy to extend or integrate into larger projects.
